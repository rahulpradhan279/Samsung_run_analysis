Samsung Run Analysis 
The script takes in data from the TEST and Train directory for the Subjects . 
First we have consolidated the Test and Train data and the Subjects data
Subsequently we have segregated those variables which pertain to Mean and Standard Deviation
The Data for TEST+Train is consolidated in a single data which contains variables Mean, STD , Activity and Subject
This data is then cleaned for variable names which can be understandable using the Features file
finally the data data is aggregated on Activity and Subject wise with average for each of the variables
The final data is then written to a text file
